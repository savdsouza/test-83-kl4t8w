## Overview

This backend architecture powers the Dog Walking Platform, offering microservices to handle user authentication, dog-walker bookings, real-time tracking, payment processing, and notifications. The solution follows a cloud-based, containerized approach with the following key capabilities:

• Microservices orchestrated using Docker (# docker@24.0) and defined in docker-compose.yml (# services, # volumes, # networks).  
• Node.js (# node@18.x) for the TypeScript-based services, Java (# openjdk@17) for Spring Boot components, and Go (# golang@1.21) for high-performance real-time tracking.  
• Emphasis on scalability, fault tolerance, and secure communication (TLS 1.3, JWT authentication).  
• Focus on user experience with transparent walker verification and robust payment workflows.

---

## Architecture

The architecture is composed of discrete microservices communicating via secure channels. Each service manages a specific capability in the platform. This design facilitates independent deployment, horizontal scaling, and fault isolation. Per the technical specification’s 2.1 High-Level Architecture, our environment includes:

• API Gateway exposing RESTful and WebSocket endpoints  
• Auth, Booking, Payment, Tracking, and Notification services  
• PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and TimescaleDB for data persistence

We rely on docker-compose.yml for local orchestration of these services. In that file:

• The “services” block enumerates each container (api-gateway, auth-service, booking-service, etc.).  
• The “volumes” block defines persistent storage (e.g., postgres_data).  
• The “networks” block configures the backend network for secure in-container traffic.

### High Availability

(references 8.2 CLOUD SERVICES/8.2.2 High Availability Architecture)

To support enterprise-grade fault tolerance:

• Multi-region Deployment: Deploy replicas of each microservice in separate regions, with load balancing at the DNS layer.  
• Failover Procedures: Implement health checks to gracefully route around outages.  
• Autoscaling: Use container orchestration to scale horizontally in response to usage demands.  
• Data Replication: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and TimescaleDB support multi-AZ or replica sets to maintain data integrity.

### Security

(references 7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS/7.1 Authentication and Authorization)

Security is embedded at every layer:

• JWT-based Authentication: The API Gateway leverages the “app” and “securityMiddleware” from server.ts (# app, # securityMiddleware) for secure session management.  
• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Auth Service enforces roles (admin, owner, walker).  
• Encryption in Transit: TLS 1.3 for microservice calls and client-server communication.  
• Zero-Trust Networking: “backend” network in docker-compose.yml ensures internal traffic isolation.  
• Defensive Coding: Argon2id password hashing, CSRF/DoS safeguards, and advanced rate-limiting via Redis.

## Services

Detailed documentation of each microservice with its configuration, scaling considerations, and operational insights:

### API Gateway

Handles request routing, rate limiting, and security controls:

• Built with Express (# node@18.x) and uses “app” from server.ts for entry point.  
• Integrates a reverse proxy approach plus WebSocket pass-through for real-time events.  
• Rate limiting with Redis for high-volume traffic.  
• Security enforcement with JWT validation and request validation (Joi).

### Auth Service

Implements JWT authentication, RBAC, and optional OAuth2 integration:

• Uses Node.js (# node@18.x) or Java (# openjdk@17) (configurable as per architecture preferences).  
• Argon2id for secure password storage and optional TOTP-based MFA.  
• Issues short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens.  
• Role-based checks for owners, walkers, and admins.

### Booking Service

Manages transaction workflows associated with dog-walker scheduling:

• Built in Node.js (# node@18.x) or Java (# openjdk@17), connected to MongoDB for booking records.  
• Availability queries, dynamic pricing, and scheduling logic.  
• Communicates with Payment Service for deposit or settlement operations.

### Tracking Service

Provides high-performance real-time GPS tracking (# golang@1.21):

• MQTT or WebSocket-based location updates.  
• TimescaleDB time-series storage for route plots and analytics.  
• Designed for minimal latency under concurrency.

### Payment Service

Responsible for PCI-compliant payment processing:

• Integrated with external payment gateways.  
• Manages financial transactions and ledger entries in PostgreSQL.  
• Ensures best-practice security (TLS, tokenization, and secret management).

### Notification Service

Enables push notifications and real-time messaging:

• Built in Python or Node (# node@18.x).  
• Sends FCM and/or APNs push updates, plus email or SMS notifications.  
• Integrates with Redis for queueing and ephemeral data storage.

---

## Development

Comprehensive guidelines and best practices for creating, testing, and extending backend services:

### Local Setup

(references 8. INFRASTRUCTURE/8.1 DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT)

Follow these steps to set up a development environment:

1. Runtime installation  
   • Install Node.js (# node@18.x) for TypeScript-based microservices.  
   • Install Java (# openjdk@17) if you need the Spring Boot-based Booking Service.  
   • Install Go (# golang@1.21) for the Tracking Service, if required.  

2. Dependencies setup  
   • Clone the repo and run “npm ci” / “yarn install” in relevant service directories.  
   • If using Gradle or Maven for Java services, ensure you run those build commands.  

3. Environment configuration  
   • Copy .env.example to .env and set all environment variables (DB credentials, JWT secrets).  
   • Ensure docker-compose.yml references the correct environment as needed.  

4. Security configuration  
   • Set up TLS certificates for local or staging use.  
   • Confirm Argon2id usage with the recommended cost parameters.  
   • Configure ephemeral tokens for dev vs. persistent tokens for staging.  

5. Service startup  
   • Spin up containers via “docker-compose up -d” (see docker-compose.yml).  
   • Confirm microservices are reachable at the assigned localhost ports.  

### Testing

We employ a multi-layer testing strategy:

• Unit Tests: Validate core logic (Jest for Node.js, JUnit for Java, etc.).  
• Integration Tests: Use test containers or ephemeral environments in docker-compose to ensure interaction correctness.  
• Security Tests: Run vulnerability scans (e.g., Snyk), plus automated checks (npm audit, etc.).  
• Performance / Stress Testing: Tools like Artillery, Gatling, or JMeter to test concurrency.

### API Standards

• RESTful Endpoints: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with path-based versioning (e.g., /api/v1).  
• JSON Payloads: For request/response, including error messages with standardized fields.  
• OpenAPI & Swagger: Optional for cross-team integration.  
• WebSocket/MQTT for real-time tracking or event-driven updates.

## Deployment

Guidelines for environment-specific deployment, from container build to production configuration:

### Container Build

(references 8.3 CONTAINERIZATION/8.3.1 Docker Configuration)

• Dockerfiles enforce multi-stage builds, non-root users, and minimal base images (# docker@24.0).  
• docker-compose.yml (# services) orchestrates all containers with internal (# networks) plus persistent (# volumes) definitions.  
• Security Hardening:  
  – Use distroless or alpine images when possible.  
  – Regular vulnerability scans.  
  – Limit container privileges and open ports.  

### Environment Setup

• Production-Grade Configuration:  
  – Use advanced networking and environment variables for secrets and DB credentials.  
  – TLS termination at a load balancer or ingress gateway for external traffic.  
• CI/CD Integration:  
  – Automated pipelines for building, testing, reviewing, scanning, and deploying images.  
  – A typical approach: Docker image built, tested in staging, then promoted to production.  

### Monitoring

• Prometheus (# prometheus@2.45) for metrics collection.  
• Grafana (# grafana@10.0) for visualization and alerting (dashboards for CPU usage, DB queries, etc.).  
• Logs aggregated in a centralized system (e.g., ELK stack or hosted logging).  
• External Uptime checks and SLO-based alerts.

---

## Maintenance

Long-term maintenance involves daily operations, patching, backups, and performance analysis:

### Backup Procedures

• Full DB Backups:  
  – PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TimescaleDB each require scheduled backups.  
  – Copy backups to offsite or alternative cloud storage for DR.  
• Testing Restores:  
  – Validate backup integrity with regular restore tests, ensuring actual data correctness.  

### Security Updates

• Patch Management:  
  – Keep Node.js (# node@18.x), Java (# openjdk@17), and Docker (# docker@24.0) images updated.  
  – Patch OS images in container templates.  
• Dependency Scans:  
  – Use npm audit, Snyk, or similar tools.  
  – Promptly address severity-level vulnerabilities.  
• Rotation of Secrets:  
  – JWT keys, DB passwords, and encryption keys must rotate periodically.  

### Performance Tuning

• Horizontal Scaling:  
  – Increase microservice replicas with the built-in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.  
• Caching Strategy:  
  – Fine-tune Redis usage to reduce DB load.  
• Database Indexing:  
  – Continual analysis of queries in PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TimescaleDB.
