    Core service for managing and orchestrating notification delivery across multiple channels

            Responsible for delivering email notifications via SMTP with retry logic.
        _push_handler (PushNotificationHandler):
            Responsible for delivering push notifications (FCM/APNs) with fault tolerance.
        _sms_handler (SMSHandler):
            Responsible for delivering SMS notifications (Twilio) with special handling for emergencies.
        _priority_queues (dict):
            Stores channel-specific notification queues for normal vs. high-priority flows.
        _channel_health (dict):
            Tracks channel health metrics, including error rates and circuit states.
