 *      - validate walk data
 *      - create walk using WalkService with potential retry
 *      - success toast
 *      - navigate to walk details
 *      - handle API errors, validation errors, network errors
 *      - finalize loading state
 *   2) handleCancel function logic, including:
 *      - confirmation dialog if form is dirty
 *      - clear form data if confirmed
 *      - navigate back to the walks list
 *      - cancellation toast
 *
