<!-- 
  This animation resource is used for screen transitions, navigation patterns, and UI element 
  dismissals in the Android app. It provides a smooth slide-out effect from the current X position 
  to -100% of the parent width, effectively moving the UI element off-screen to the left.

  Requirements Addressed:
  - Smooth UI Transitions: Uses accelerate_decelerate interpolator with a 300ms duration for 
    natural motion and an enhanced user experience.
  - Navigation Patterns: Supports slide-out animation from 0 to -100%p X-delta, aligning with 
    the [<] previous indicator and typical screen/drawer dismissals.

  External Import:
  - android.view.animation (# version default)
    Provides core Android animation capabilities for TranslateAnimation.

  Animation Properties:
  - type: translate
  - fromXDelta: 0
  - toXDelta: -100%p
  - duration_ms: 300
  - interpolator: accelerate_decelerate
  - fill_after: true

  Usage Contexts:
  - Fragment transitions
  - Activity transitions
  - Navigation drawer animations
  - Screen navigation transitions
  - Dialog dismissal effects

  Accessibility Considerations:
  - Respects system animation scale, aligning with user accessibility settings for reduced motion.
  - Motion sensitivity compliant with a moderate default duration.
  - RTL support can be managed by alternative resource qualifiers if full directional mirroring 
    is required.

  Performance Impact:
  - Minimal memory footprint.
  - Optimized animation smoothness for a seamless 60fps experience on devices API level 26+ (Android 8.0+).
