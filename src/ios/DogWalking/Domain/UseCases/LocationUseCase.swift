//  DogWalking
//
//  Created by Enterprise-Ready AI on 2023-10-01.
//
//  This file defines the LocationUseCase class, which coordinates real-time location
//  tracking for dog walks with battery optimization and privacy controls. It provides
//  a domain-level interface that sits between the UI layer and low-level data
//  management, fulfilling the following requirements:
//
//  1. Real-time Location Tracking - Leverages a repository to start/stop tracking
//     GPS location updates with accuracy profiles, ensuring battery efficiency.
//  2. Location Data Management  - Fetches complete walk routes from persistent storage,
//     applying privacy filters and security measures while calculating total distances.
//
//  Dependencies:
//    • Foundation  (iOS 13.0+) - Basic iOS functionality
//    • Combine     (iOS 13.0+) - Reactive programming with memory management
//    • Location    (Domain/Models/Location.swift) - Thread-safe location model
//    • LocationRepository (Data/Repositories/LocationRepository.swift) - Repository
//      for location data management, offline support, and error handling
//
//  Implementation Notes:
//    • The LocationUseCase class applies thread safety through a dedicated calculationQueue
//      for distance computations, preventing race conditions.
//    • Real-time updates are published via locationUpdates subject, with errors propagated
//      to subscribers accordingly.
//    • The class maintains a totalDistance publisher and a lastLocation cache to track walk
//      distance in real-time. Stale data is reset after each stop.
//
//  Exports:
//    • locationUpdates (PassthroughSubject<Location, Error>)
//    • totalDistance   (CurrentValueSubject<Double, Never>)
//    • startWalkTracking(_ walkId: UUID) -> AnyPublisher<Location, Error>
//    • stopWalkTracking()
//    • getWalkRoute(_ walkId: UUID) -> AnyPublisher<[Location], Error>
//
