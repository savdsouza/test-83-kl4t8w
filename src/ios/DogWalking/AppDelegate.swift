//  Main application delegate class responsible for handling application lifecycle events,
//  configuring core services, and managing push notifications for the Dog Walking iOS application
//  with enhanced security, performance, and reliability features.
//
//  This file addresses the following key requirements from the technical specifications:
//    • Push Notifications (Enhanced integration with notification services for real-time updates
//      with improved security and reliability.)
//    • Real-time Features (WebSocket-based tracking and messaging with secure push notifications
//      and background processing optimization.)
//    • Location Services (Battery-optimized GPS tracking for real-time location updates during walks
//      with enhanced privacy controls.)

     Enhanced application launch method with secure service initialization and error handling.
     
     Steps:
     1. Acquire service initialization lock to ensure thread safety during startup.
     2. Initialize or reconfigure the dedicated notification queue (if needed).
     3. Configure all core services (push notifications, location services) with dependency injection.
     4. Set up push notifications, requesting user authorization and validation of the process.
     5. Configure location services for battery optimization, background usage, and privacy controls.
     6. Initialize the main application window and root view controller.
     7. Release the service initialization lock.
     8. Return a Boolean indicating a successful launch.
     
     - Parameters:
       - application: The singleton app object.
       - launchOptions: Dictionary of launch-time options.
     - Returns: True if the application finished launching successfully, otherwise false.
