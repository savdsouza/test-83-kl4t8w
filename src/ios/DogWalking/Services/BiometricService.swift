/**
 A thread-safe service class that manages high-level biometric authentication functionality
 with enhanced security features, comprehensive error handling, and secure state persistence.

 This class utilizes BiometricAuthManager for core biometric interactions and KeychainManager
 for securely storing user preferences (such as whether biometrics are currently enabled).
 It publishes authentication state changes via a PassthroughSubject for reactive subscribers.
 
 Usage Notes (High-Level):
 - Call `isBiometricAuthAvailable()` to determine whether biometrics can be used or are enabled.
 - Call `enableBiometricAuth` to turn on biometric auth, storing preferences in the Keychain.
 - Call `disableBiometricAuth` to turn off biometric auth, removing preferences from the Keychain.
 - Call `authenticateUser` to perform a real-time biometric check, respecting retry limits and timeouts.
 - When necessary, call `resetAuthenticationState` to clear counters and state in a secure fashion.
