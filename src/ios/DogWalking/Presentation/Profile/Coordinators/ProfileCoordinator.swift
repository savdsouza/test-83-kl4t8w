/// A thread-safe coordinator that manages navigation flow and dependency injection for
/// the profile section. It leverages a navigation lock (NSLock) to ensure operations
/// against UIKit are dispatched serially, preventing race conditions. In addition, it
/// implements robust memory management by tracking Combine subscriptions and offering
/// a cleanup routine to release references when needed.
///
/// This coordinator addresses:
/// - User Management: By integrating with userUseCase for profile data.
/// - Navigation Architecture: By employing the coordinator pattern to start and manage
///   the profile flow with minimal coupling to other app components.
///
/// Usage:
/// 1. Initialize ProfileCoordinator with a UINavigationController and UserUseCase.
/// 2. Call start() to launch the profile section in a thread-safe manner.
/// 3. Use showEditProfile(_:) to present an edit flow if required.
/// 4. Invoke cleanUp() to release resources and child coordinators when the flow completes.
