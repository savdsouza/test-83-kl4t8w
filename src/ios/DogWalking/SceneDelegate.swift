//  Description:
//  Scene delegate class responsible for managing the app's window and root view controller
//  in a multi-window environment, implementing robust lifecycle management, state restoration,
//  and secure navigation coordination.
//
//  This file addresses the following requirements based on the technical specification:
//  1. Mobile Apps (Native iOS app with modern scene-based lifecycle).
//  2. Navigation Architecture (Coordinator pattern with secure state handling).
//  3. Security Layer (Scene validation, data protection, state restoration).
