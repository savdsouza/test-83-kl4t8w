  FILE DESCRIPTION:
  This file extends the Swift Date class with specialized methods for the
  DogWalking application. These methods address scheduling logic, formatted
  output for UI, operating hours checks, walk duration calculation, and
  ensuring that time intervals meet the dog walking domain requirements.

  INTERNAL IMPORTS:
  - References "MapConstants.LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL" from the internal file
    "src/ios/DogWalking/Core/Constants/AppConstants.swift".
    This constant is used to validate location update intervals for
    time-sensitive operations.

  EXTERNAL IMPORTS:
  - Foundation (iOS 13.0+): Provides Date, TimeZone, Locale, and DateFormatter
    functionalities used extensively throughout this extension.

/**
 Extension providing dog-walking-specific functionality for the Date type,
 exposing methods necessary to handle real-time booking availability checks,
 scheduling constraints, domain-specific date/time formatting, and more.
 This extension is designed with an enterprise-level coding approach: it uses
 robust error-checking, thorough documentation, and well-commented logic to
 support reliability in a production environment.

     Determines if the current Date instance is viable for creating a new walk

       1. It is strictly in the future (cannot book a same-moment or past time).
       2. It respects the specified minimum notice period.
       3. It falls within defined operating hours.
       4. No existing bookings conflict with this time.
       5. It aligns with any regional or location-based availability rules.

     - Parameter minimumNotice: The minimum time interval (in seconds) that must
       elapse from the current moment (now) until this date, to accommodate
       short-notice bookings and operational overhead.
     - Returns: A Boolean indicating whether this date is available for booking.

    /**
     Generates a locale- and timezone-appropriate string representing the
     Date instance, intended for usage in walk-related UI elements, such
     as booking confirmations or active walk screens.

     This method:
       1. Applies optional user-specified locale for regional formatting nuances.
       2. Converts to an optional specified time zone if provided, else uses
          the system or device setting.
       3. Chooses a medium date style with a short time style for clarity in displays.
       4. Automatically handles daylight saving transitions if the parameter
          `timeZone` observes DST.

     - Parameters:
       - timeZone: The desired timezone context. Defaults to `nil`, meaning
                   the system timezone is used.
       - locale: The desired locale context for date formatting. Defaults to
                 `nil`, meaning the system locale is used.

     Calculates the time interval (in seconds) since a given last update time.
     This method can be crucial for verifying how frequently location updates,
     status updates, or other real-time data refreshes are occurring.

     Steps:
       1. Compute the absolute time difference between `self` and `lastUpdateTime`.
       2. While time zones do not directly affect the raw difference in seconds,
          acknowledge that bridging from absolute time to localized displays
          may require further adjustment in downstream usage.
       3. Validate this difference against `MapConstants.LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL`
          if you wish to impose constraints on how quickly subsequent updates occur.
       4. For a neater integer-like value, the result is rounded to the nearest
          whole second.

     - Parameter lastUpdateTime: The date/time stamp of the previous update event.
     - Returns: A TimeInterval representing the number of seconds between the
                last update time and this date, rounded to a whole number.

        // STEP 2: Note on time zone transitions. Even if the device timezone changes,
        //         the raw difference in seconds remains the same. Additional
        //         adjustments for displaying time could be performed as needed.
        //         Here, we simply compute the absolute difference.

        // STEP 3: Validate or compare with MapConstants.LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL.
        //         Example usage: you might check if difference < LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL
        //         to see if an update is happening too soon.
