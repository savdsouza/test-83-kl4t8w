/// An abstract, thread-safe base class that implements the `Coordinator` protocol
/// and provides a comprehensive navigation management framework for iOS applications.
/// This class manages complex navigation flows, supports deep linking, ensures
/// concurrency safety using `NSLock`, and applies memory-efficient practices.
///
/// Usage:
/// - Subclass `BaseCoordinator` to create specialized coordinators for distinct domains
///   within the application (e.g., onboarding, main flow, authentication).
/// - Override the `start()` method to configure and present the initial view controllers.
/// - Use `addChildCoordinator(_:)` and `removeChildCoordinator(_:)` to manage child flows.
///
/// Thread-Safety:
/// - All mutating operations on `childCoordinators` are guarded using `coordinatorLock`.
/// - UIKit calls are restricted to the main thread for UI consistency.
///
/// Memory Management:
/// - Child coordinators are strongly retained in `childCoordinators` while active.
/// - Removing a coordinator from the array upon completion prevents memory leaks.
///
/// Deep Linking:
/// - Subclasses can override or extend `handleDeepLink(_:)` to handle specific routes.
/// - Ensures that the appropriate navigation stack is prepared before linking to a screen.
