## 1. Overview
The Dog Walking iOS application connects dog owners with professional walkers through a real-time, location-based service. It supports:  
- On-demand booking and scheduling  
- Real-time location tracking (securely integrated with location services)  
- Secure payment workflows via external payment gateways  
- Device coverage from iOS 13 onwards for broader user adoption  

The application employs Swift 5.9, Apple’s recommended language for iOS development, enabling modern concurrency patterns, improved maintainability, and high performance. This document outlines how to set up, build, test, and deploy the iOS app with consistent best practices.

---

## 2. System Requirements
• macOS Ventura 13.0+ to access new Swift toolchains and stable performance  
• Xcode 15.0+ with the latest iOS SDK and Swift toolchain  
• CocoaPods 1.13.0 for dependency management  
• SwiftLint 0.52.0 for code style enforcement  
• Fastlane 2.214.0 for continuous integration and deployment tasks  
• iOS devices running iOS 13.0+ (iPhones & iPads)  
• Enough free storage (10 GB recommended) for Xcode caches and derived data  

These requirements ensure the application can be built, run, and tested under the targeted environment.

## 3. Project Structure
Below is a high-level overview of how the iOS codebase organizes files and folders:

1. DogWalking/
   - AppDelegate.swift → Application delegate and lifecycle management  
   - SceneDelegate.swift → Scene-based lifecycle for iOS 13+  
   - Info.plist → Application configuration, capabilities, usage descriptions  
   - Podfile → CocoaPods dependencies  
   - Core/ → Foundation classes (utilities, base classes, protocols)  
     - Utilities/ → Networking, logging, keychain, location services  
     - Extensions/ → UIView, String, and other custom type extensions  
     - Constants/ → App-wide constants, color definitions, typography  
     - Base/ → BaseViewController, BaseViewModel for shared architecture patterns  
   - Data/ → Data layer, repositories, networking code  
   - Domain/ → Business logic models, entities, user or dog objects  
   - Presentation/ → UI layer (ViewControllers, Views, Coordinators, SwiftUI or UIKit screens)  
   - Services/ → Real-time or push notification services, extension points  
   - Tests/ → Automated unit tests, integration tests, UI tests  

This structure promotes:
- Clear separation of concerns (Core, Data, Domain, Presentation)
- Easier test coverage
- Reusability and maintainability across the codebase

## 4. Environment Setup
Follow these steps to prepare for iOS development on the Dog Walking project:

1. Install Xcode 15.0 or Higher  
   - Download via the Mac App Store or from Apple’s Developer portal.  
   - Confirm installation by running:  
     xcodebuild -version  

2. Command Line Tools  
   - Install matching Command Line Tools:  
     xcode-select --install  

3. Install Ruby & Bundler (Optional)  
   - If you use a Ruby environment manager (rbenv or rvm), set it to Ruby 3+ for consistent gem installations.  

4. Install CocoaPods (1.13.0)  
   - gem install cocoapods -v 1.13.0  
   - Confirm with: pod --version  

5. SwiftLint (0.52.0)  
   - brew install swiftlint  
   - Lint checks automatically run as part of the build script or pre-commit.  

6. Fastlane (2.214.0) for CI/CD  
   - gem install fastlane -NV  
   - Confirm with: fastlane --version  

7. Clone the Repository  
   - git clone <repository_url>  
   - cd ios  

8. Install Dependencies  
   - pod install  

9. Open Workspace  
   - open DogWalking.xcworkspace  

10. Code Signing & Provisioning  
   - In Xcode’s Signing & Capabilities tab, configure team, provisioning profiles, and bundle identifiers.  

With these steps, your environment will be ready to build, run, and test the iOS Dog Walking application.

## 5. Building & Running
1. Launch Xcode and open DogWalking.xcworkspace.  
2. Choose the “DogWalking” scheme in the scheme selector.  
3. Select a device simulator (e.g., iPhone 14) or use a physical device.  
4. Clean the build folder (Cmd+Shift+K) if needed to remove stale artifacts.  
5. Build (Cmd+B) and then Run (Cmd+R).  
6. Watch the Xcode Debug area for relevant logs, SwiftLint warnings, or run-time messages.  
7. Use Instruments or the Debug Navigator for performance profiling if required.

## 6. Development Guidelines
The iOS Dog Walking application follows an MVVM architecture with Coordinators:
- View → Responsible for rendering UI, restricted logic.  
- ViewModel → Handles business logic, transformations, and state.  
- Coordinator → Orchestrates navigation flows.  
- Repository → Provides data through network or local storage.  

Adhere to:
1. SwiftLint rules → Run automatically on build, or manually with swiftlint.  
2. Code reviews → Ensure 2+ approvals with strict quality checks.  
3. Code style → Use Swift recommended patterns, limit forced unwrapping, prefer strong type safety.  
4. iOS 13+ Features → Scenes, combined with dark mode support, Combine for reactive flows.  

Real-time tracking uses location services optimized for battery usage. Secure payment flows rely on external gateway tokens, stored in the Keychain with robust encryption. Always check for user consents and permissions.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy
Use XCTest for unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests to maintain ~80% coverage:

1. Unit Tests:  
   - Check business logic in ViewModels, Repositories.  
   - Maintain coverage for domain transformations, data validations.  

2. Integration Tests:  
   - Validate end-to-end flows: e.g., Registration + Login + Real-time tracking.  
   - Use mocks/stubs for network calls or create ephemeral sessions.  

3. UI Tests:  
   - Leverage Xcode’s UI Testing to ensure critical flows (e.g., booking a walk, payment) remain stable.  
   - Run them on multiple simulators or physical devices.  

4. Continuous Integration:  
   - Use Fastlane to automate test runs, code coverage, and reporting.  
   - Integrate results into pull requests or an internal CI system (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).  

5. Accessibility Tests:  
   - Optionally check dynamic type, VoiceOver, color contrast.  

---

## 8. Deployment Process
We rely on Fastlane for build automation and App Store distribution:

1. Increment Build Number → fastlane run increment_build_number  
2. swiftlint → Validate code style.  
3. Build & Test → fastlane test or xcodebuild test.  
4. Beta Distribution → fastlane pilot upload  
5. Production Release → fastlane appstore  
6. Monitor Crash Reports → Use Xcode Organizer or third-party (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics).  

Ensure code signing identities, provisioning profiles, and Apple Developer credentials are configured in your Fastlane/Appfile.

## 9. Best Practices & Performance
1. Overview  
   - Preserve 99.9% uptime by designing a resilient codebase with fallback strategies for real-time location.  
   - Utilization of Combine for asynchronous streams reduces thread overhead.  

2. Performance Optimization  
   - Profile with Instruments for memory usage and CPU hotspots.  
   - Offload heavy tasks to background threads.  
   - Cache repeated data in memory (e.g., user session info).  

3. Security Enhancements  
   - Use Keychain for sensitive tokens and credentials.  
   - Enforce TLS 1.3.  
   - Optionally adopt certificate pinning for critical endpoints.  

4. Battery Efficiency (Location Updates)  
   - Request location permission with .whenInUse or .always carefully.  
   - Use iOS background tasks conservatively.  
   - Implement location updates with recommended intervals for minimal battery usage.  

5. Observability & Logging  
   - Use os.log or custom Logger for structured events.  
   - Aggregate logs in real-time to monitor crashes, errors, or anomalies.  

6. Database & Persistence  
   - For local caching (Realm, SQLite) follow encryption best practices if needed.
