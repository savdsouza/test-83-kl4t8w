- Access to secure signing keys (RS256) for token generation.
- Enforce strong passwords and 2FA in dev environment accounts if connected to public networks.

### 2.3 Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourOrganization/dog-walking-app.git
   ```
2. Install global dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Docker, Node, or required packages
   # If you're on macOS:
   brew install docker node
   ```
3. Initialize submodules (if present):
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
4. Install local dependencies:
   - iOS: CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager
   - Android: Gradle sync
   - Backend: Maven or npm install as needed

For in-depth steps, refer to the [Getting Started Section](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting_started) in CONTRIBUTING.md.

### 2.4 Configuration
- Copy the sample environment file: `cp ./env.sample ./.env`
- Update `.env` with:
  - Database credentials (POSTGRES_URI, MONGO_URI, REDIS_URI)
  - JWT secret or RSA private key
  - Payment gateway API keys

### 2.5 Security Configuration
- Configure SSL certificates for local testing if possible.
- Set secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure).
- Use strong cryptographic ciphers (TLS 1.3).
- Reference additional guidelines in [Security Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#security_guidelines).

### 2.6 Running Locally
- Start Docker containers (if using docker-compose):
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- iOS or Android:
  - Open project in Xcode / Android Studio and run on the simulator or device.
- Backend:
  - For Node services: `npm install && npm start`
  - For Java services: `mvn spring-boot:run` or use your IDE run configurations.

### 2.7 Troubleshooting
- Check container logs for port conflicts or missing environment variables.
- Verify you have the correct versions of required tools.
- For iOS signing issues, ensure team provisioning profiles are configured.

- Logging ingestion into ELK or Datadog for correlation

### 6.6 Incident Response
1. Detection:
   - Alerts from intrusion detection or logs
2. Containment:
   - Temporarily disable affected microservice
3. Investigation:
   - Root cause analysis by the security team
