# Monitoring Infrastructure

Comprehensive overview of the monitoring stack components, security considerations, and integration architecture. This documentation addresses:  
• System Monitoring (Section 2.4.1) via Prometheus (v2.45.0), ELK Stack (Elasticsearch v7.17.0 & Kibana v7.17.0), and Jaeger (v1.28.0).  
• Success Criteria (Section 1.2) through custom dashboards, real-time alerting, and SLA tracking for 99.9% uptime.  
• High Availability (Section 2.5.1) with multi-AZ deployment, health checks, failover procedures, and auto-scaling telemetry.

## Architecture Overview
The monitoring architecture combines multiple open-source tools for metrics, logs, and traces:

1. Prometheus (v2.45.0):  
   • Collects metrics from microservices using the [scrape_configs] defined in prometheus_config.  
   • Evaluates [alert_rules] (from Prometheus alerts) to notify on SLA violations.  
   • Stores short-term time-series data for high-resolution insight.

2. Grafana (v9.5.0):  
   • Visualizes metrics through dynamic dashboards, including the [dashboard_config] from services_dashboard.  
   • Integrates with external alert panels ([alert_panels]) for service health and performance.  
   • Offers role-based access control for multiple teams.

3. Jaeger (v1.28.0 via jaeger-operator):  
   • Traces end-to-end request flows across microservices.  
   • Applies [sampling_strategies] to balance overhead and visibility.  
   • Uses [storage_config] for durable trace retention in Elasticsearch.

4. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch v7.17.0, Kibana v7.17.0):  
   • Aggregates and indexes all logs for search, correlation, and archival.  
   • Hosts near-real-time log dashboards and advanced filtering.

## Component Descriptions
• Prometheus Server: Core metrics engine polling each service endpoint.  
• Alertmanager: Dispatches alerts to e-mail, Slack, or paging systems.  
• Grafana Dashboards: Offer curated overviews of system performance, usage, business KPIs, and SLO compliance.  
• Jaeger Collector & Query: Ingest trace data from microservices and provide a UI for trace analysis.  
• Elasticsearch & Kibana: Centralized log indexing, visualization, and analytics.  
• Logstash (optional pipeline): Transforms logs into structured events for advanced indexing.

## Security Considerations
• All Prometheus endpoints are secured via TLS and network policies restricting unauthorized access.  
• Elasticsearch and Kibana rely on TLS-based node-to-node encryption and user authentication (X-Pack).  
• Jaeger components require secure transport for collectors and explicit user permissions for advanced trace queries.  
• Grafana implements granular access control to safeguard dashboards (e.g., read-only vs. admin roles).  
• Automated CVE scans (e.g., Trivy) are applied to all container images.

## High Availability Setup
• Multi-node Prometheus in an HA pair or federation for resilient data collection.  
• Redundant Alertmanager instances for seamless alert routing during failures.  
• Elasticsearch cluster with at least three data nodes to tolerate zone outages.  
• Jaeger collectors horizontally scaled, distributing ingestion load across multiple pods.  
• Cross-AZ usage for each monitoring service, ensuring minimal downtime if an AZ fails.

## Data Flow Diagrams
Below is a simplified data flow representation:

1. Services → Prometheus (Metrics Pull)  
2. Services → Jaeger Agent → Jaeger Collector (Tracing)  
3. Services → Logstash → Elasticsearch (Logs)  
4. Prometheus → Alertmanager (Alerts)  
5. Monitoring Tools → Grafana & Kibana (Visualization)  

Typical sequence: a microservice emits metrics, logs, and traces, which flow into Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and Jaeger. Grafana queries Prometheus for metrics while Kibana queries Elasticsearch logs. Jaeger’s Query UI provides distributed trace views.

# Metrics Collection

Detailed configuration of Prometheus metrics collection, alert rules, and custom metrics to meet operational and SLA requirements.

## Prometheus HA Setup
• Deploy two Prometheus instances in active-active mode with identical [scrape_configs] referencing each microservice.  
• Shared persistent storage or Thanos sidecar can unify metrics if global aggregation is required.  
• Use consistent external_labels for environment and region to track cross-AZ metrics.

## Service Endpoints
• Each microservice exposes “/metrics” on port 9090 (or similar) for Prometheus ingestion.  
• The [scrape_configs] in prometheus_config define how each service (api-gateway, auth-service, booking-service, payment-service, tracking-service, notification-service) is polled.  
• For ephemeral or auto-scaled containers, rely on service discovery (Kubernetes, ECS) or static_configs.

## Alert Rules
• The [alert_rules] from prometheus_config specify conditions for high error rates, latencies, or reduced availability.  
• Alerts are grouped into categories:  
  1. service_health (e.g., <99.9% uptime)  
  2. performance (e.g., p95 Latency >2s)  
  3. business_alerts (e.g., payment failures)  
  4. resource_alerts (e.g., high CPU/mem usage)  
• AlertManager routes these alerts to on-call teams for immediate response.

## Recording Rules
• Precompute frequent queries (e.g., CPU usage ratio, request error ratio) to lighten Prometheus query load.  
• Examples include service:request_duration:p95, resource:memory:usage, and custom calculations for business KPIs.  
• The group intervals range from every 30s to 2m, ensuring real-time event correlation.

## Custom Metrics
• Each microservice can log domain-specific counters, gauges, or histograms (e.g., active_walks_total, payment_transactions_total).  
• Example: booking-service uses booking throughput metrics, while notification-service tracks push delivery success vs. failures.  
• Consistent naming conventions “<service>_<metric_name>” simplify global queries.

## Resource Utilization
• System-level metrics track CPU, memory, and network usage at container, node, and cluster level.  
• Aggregated by Prometheus to power capacity planning, auto-scaling triggers, and cost optimization.  
• Sustained usage trends are separated from short-lived spikes to avoid false positives.

# Visualization

Comprehensive Grafana dashboard configuration and visualization guidelines to facilitate real-time monitoring and rapid troubleshooting.

## Dashboard Overview
• The central “Dog Walking Services Overview” references the [dashboard_config] from services_dashboard.  
• Live displays for SLO compliance (99.9% uptime), latencies, error rates, and active walk volumes.  
• Basic health checks on each microservice’s “up” metric provide quick overall status.

## Custom Dashboards
• Departments or teams can build specialized panels focusing on their domain (e.g., booking success, walker retention).  
• The JSON-based [alert_panels] from services_dashboard can be expanded into custom panels for advanced correlation.  
• Clone and adjust base dashboards to focus on environment-specific or region-specific stats.

## Alert Visualization
• Prometheus alerts are integrated into Grafana’s “Alerting” interface, enabling severity-based alert grouping.  
• Each alert includes runbook links, recommended actions, and auto-escalation paths for streamlined triage.  
• Color-coded thresholds highlight near-breaching vs. critical states.

## User Guide
• Users log in with their Grafana credentials to view or modify dashboards.  
• Team leads or admins grant read or edit privileges, restricting environment or service changes to authorized personnel.  
• Panels support drilling into historical data for deeper investigations of resource usage or user activity patterns.

## Access Control
• Grafana enforces role-based access (Admin, Editor, Viewer).  
• For multi-tenant usage, organizations or teams have separate folders and data sources.  
• Single Sign-On (SSO) with OAuth2 or SAML can unify user management across multiple systems.

## Dashboard Backup
• Regularly export JSON definitions to version control—especially the “Dog Walking Services Overview” dashboard_config.  
• Automated backups through Grafana’s API or CI/CD pipelines preserve custom dashboards and panel configurations.

# Distributed Tracing

Detailed Jaeger tracing implementation and analysis procedures to observe end-to-end request flows and diagnose latencies.

## Jaeger HA Setup
• Deploy multiple Jaeger collectors and agents; collectors push spans to Elasticsearch if vertical scaling is insufficient.  
• The Jaeger operator (v1.28.0) monitors CRDs in Kubernetes for automated scaling.  
• Use persistent volumes for caching queued spans during traffic spikes.

## Sampling Strategies
• Configured [sampling_strategies] in jaeger_config define per-service sampling rates (up to 100% for critical flows like payments).  
• Lower sampling for tasks generating large volumes (tracking-service) to reduce overhead.  
• Dynamic or adaptive sampling can be considered for peak loads to balance performance and trace completeness.

## Trace Analysis
• Investigate call flows across microservices for slow endpoints, repeated errors, or suboptimal concurrency.  
• The Jaeger UI displays operation timelines, logs, and child spans to highlight hotspots.  
• Tag queries (e.g., user_id, dog_id) correlate domain-specific tracing data with real-time usage.

## Performance Impact
• Minimal overhead at moderate sampling rates (<5% for high-traffic services).  
• Higher sampling ensures deeper visibility but increases ingestion load on collector and storage.  
• Observed overhead typically remains under 5% CPU usage on modern setups.

## Storage Management
• The [storage_config] references Elasticsearch with index-prefix “jaeger.”  
• Spans older than X days can be rolled to warm or cold indices if long retention is needed.  
• Fine-tune shard sizes, replication factor, and ingestion concurrency for stable performance.

## Security Controls
• TLS encryption for collector endpoints, agent-collector traffic, and Elasticsearch transport.  
• Enforced authentication to restrict trace queries for sensitive data (e.g., personal user details).  
• SAML or OIDC integration can apply role-based access to Jaeger’s web UI.

# Log Management

Comprehensive ELK Stack configuration and log management procedures, ensuring valuable insights into system events and their correlation with metrics.

## Elasticsearch Configuration
• The cluster uses [dogwalking-monitoring] (three data nodes) with TLS-based node-to-node encryption.  
• Indices separated by log type (app logs, security logs, access logs) to simplify retention policies.  
• Shard allocation and replication factor set to ensure resilience in multi-AZ scenarios.

## Logstash Pipelines
• Typical pipeline: input from containers or Fluent Bit → filtering by environment/service → output to Elasticsearch.  
• Enable persistent queues for reliability in the event of a pipeline or node outage.  
• X-Pack monitoring in Logstash captures pipeline-level metrics, ensuring capacity is sized properly.

## Kibana Dashboards
• Provides a user-friendly interface for searching logs, building visualizations, and creating anomaly detection jobs.  
• Reserved spaces or indexes for each environment (dev/staging/production) help isolate data sets.  
• Role-based access ensures that only approved staff can see or export logs containing PII.

## Log Retention
• Retention policies define how long logs remain in hot storage, after which they migrate to warm/cold tiers or backups.  
• Common operational logs may stay for 30 days, while business or compliance logs may be stored for 6+ months.  
• Lifecycle policies reduce storage costs by automatically deleting or archiving older indices.

## Security Settings
• All Elasticsearch HTTP and transport ports require TLS.  
• Fine-grained controls in Kibana (7.17.0) limit queries to authorized teams.  
• Audit logs track who accessed or changed system configurations, supporting compliance needs.

## Backup Procedures
• Routine snapshots to Amazon S3 or cloud storage for indefinite data retention.  
• Validate snapshot integrity regularly, ensuring quick restore if catastrophic failures occur.  
• Automated or on-demand triggers store snapshots before significant system updates.

# Operational Procedures

Detailed guidelines for operating and maintaining the monitoring infrastructure, ensuring stability, performance, and security over the full lifecycle.

## Health Checks
• Continuous checks: Prometheus “up” metric, Elasticsearch cluster health, Jaeger collector throughput.  
• Quick status overview in Grafana with color-coded tiles for each microservice.  
• Alert thresholds for partial or major node failures to expedite root-cause isolation.

## Backup Procedures
• Configuration backups (Prometheus rules, Grafana dashboards, Logstash pipelines) stored in a version control system.  
• Routine snapshots for Elasticsearch indices and Jaeger spans.  
• Validate restore processes in staging during quarterly disaster recovery drills.

## Scaling Guidelines
• Evaluate CPU/memory usage from [resource_utilization] metrics in Prometheus.  
• Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) or cluster scaling policies in ECS/Kubernetes ensure capacity.  
• GPU or specialized resources can be attached for advanced data analytics tasks if needed.

## Troubleshooting
• Investigate alerts from the service_health or resource_alerts categories first.  
• Check combined dashboards in Grafana to identify correlated events across metrics, logs, and traces.  
• Use Kibana for in-depth log analysis and Jaeger for distributed call tracing.  
• For advanced pipeline issues, consult Logstash logs and queue statuses.

## Disaster Recovery
• Maintain multi-region clusters or cross-AZ replication for Elasticsearch data.  
• Regularly test failover of Prometheus servers and Jaeger collectors.  
• Document failback procedures and ensure consistent data re-synchronization.

## Security Maintenance
• Frequent patching of Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Jaeger.  
• TLS certificate rotation for all endpoints.  
• Access reviews for user accounts, API tokens, and ephemeral secrets.  
• Intrusion detection system or SIEM integration for malicious activity alerts.
