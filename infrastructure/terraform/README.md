## prerequisites
This section covers the fundamental requirements and assumptions needed before configuring or deploying the Terraform infrastructure:

1. A valid AWS account with IAM credentials that allow multi-region deployments.  
2. The AWS credentials must have appropriate permissions to create, manage, and destroy resources (e.g., IAM roles, VPCs, security groups, EC2, ECS, etc.).  
3. Installation of Terraform (~> 1.6.0).  
4. Access to or creation of a remote state backend (e.g., AWS S3 with DynamoDB locking or other equivalents).  
5. A Git-based version control system for tracking and versioning infrastructure code changes.  
6. Basic understanding of Terraform modules, outputs, variables, and providers.  
7. Internal knowledge of environment naming conventions (dev, staging, prod), as enforced by the “environment” variable in variables.tf.  
8. Familiarity with cross-region strategies, referencing the multi-region “aws_regions” variable that sets the primary and secondary AWS providers.

## getting_started
Below are step-by-step instructions to set up your local environment and begin working with the infrastructure code:

1. Clone the Repository  
   - Retrieve the source code from the official repository or your internal GitHub Enterprise instance containing this Terraform configuration.

2. Configure the Workspace  
   - Ensure that your command line or Terraform Cloud workspace is appropriately set to the desired environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod).  
   - Terraform typically associates workspace naming with your environment variable. For example:  
     › terraform workspace new dev  
     › terraform workspace select dev  

3. AWS Credentials Setup  
   - Export AWS credentials and environment variables required for the providers. For example:  
     › export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=…  
     › export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=…  
   - If assuming a role, ensure the relevant external ID and role ARN are configured in provider.tf (aws_provider_primary and aws_provider_secondary).

4. Install Required Terraform Providers  
   - Terraform will automatically download the hashicorp/aws (~> 5.0), hashicorp/random (~> 3.0), and hashicorp/null (~> 3.0) providers on init.

5. Explore Variables and Defaults  
   - Review infrastructure/terraform/variables.tf to understand all adjustable parameters such as vpc_configuration, security_controls, backup_configuration, etc.

6. Prepare Remote Backend (Optional / Recommended)  
   - Configure a remote state backend in your backend.tf (not shown) or Terraform Cloud for state locking, versioning, and collaboration.

7. Initialize Terraform  
   - Run:  
     › terraform init  
   - This pulls down modules, sets up providers, and prepares your workspace.

8. Validate and Plan  
   - Run:  
     › terraform validate  
     › terraform plan  
   - Confirm that the plan meets your infrastructure requirements without errors.

## module_structure
The infrastructure is organized using a modular design to promote reusability and clarity. Below is an outline of how Terraform modules should be structured and documented using the ModuleStructure class as defined in the specification.

### ModuleStructure Class
A specialized class that details how each module is defined and documented:

- Properties:
  - module_name (string): The logical name of the module (e.g., “vpc”, “ecs_cluster”).  
  - purpose (string): A summary of the module’s primary responsibilities (e.g., “Creates a secure VPC with subnets”).  
  - dependencies (list): Other modules or external services upon which this module relies (e.g., “iam_roles”, “rds_instance”).  
  - variables (map): All input variables accepted by the module, with a short description and default values if applicable.  
  - outputs (map): Key outputs that other modules or stacks may consume (e.g., VPC ID, Security Group IDs).

- Functions:
  - describe_module(module_name: string): returns string  
    - Steps:
      1. Document module purpose and scope.  
      2. List and describe all resources.  
      3. Document input variables and defaults.  
      4. Explain module outputs and usage.  
      5. Provide configuration examples.  
      6. Include dependency information.  
      7. Add security considerations.

### Example of Using describe_module
```hcl
# Hypothetical usage of describe_module function in a specialized
# markdown or doc generation pipeline.
locals {
  module_doc = ModuleStructure.describe_module("vpc")
}
```
This function would generate a comprehensive report of the “vpc” module, covering resources, input parameters, outputs, security notes, and usage references.

## deployment_guide
This section details how to deploy the Dog Walking Platform’s infrastructure using Terraform. It is composed of two main functions: init_infrastructure and deploy_infrastructure.

### init_infrastructure(environment: string)
Description: Comprehensive instructions for initializing the Terraform infrastructure for the specified environment.

Steps:
1. Configure AWS credentials and access keys.  
2. Select the appropriate workspace for environment (dev, staging, prod).  
3. Initialize Terraform with required providers (aws, random, null).  
4. Configure backend for state management (e.g., remote S3 bucket, Terraform Cloud).  
5. Validate module configurations (terraform validate).  
6. Generate and review infrastructure plan (terraform plan).  
7. Verify security configurations for encryption and compliance.  
8. Check compliance requirements (backup retention, data retention, etc.).

### deploy_infrastructure(environment: string)
Description: Detailed deployment procedure for the specified environment.

Steps:
1. Review and approve the Terraform plan (best practice to have a peer or admin sign off).  
2. Apply infrastructure changes with proper approvals (terraform apply).  
3. Verify resource creation and configurations (e.g., confirm subnets, SG rules, ECS cluster).  
4. Enable monitoring and alerting (hook up to CloudWatch, Datadog, etc.).  
5. Configure security controls and WAF rules (ensure the WAF is attached to relevant ALBs or CF distributions).  
6. Validate high availability setup (check multi-AZ provisioned, cross-region replication or failover).  
7. Test failover procedures (manual or scripted DR drill).  
8. Document deployment outcomes (save final plan output, note issues or changes).

## security_compliance
Security controls span from encryption to network isolation. Below is a high-level overview:

1. WAF Configurations  
   - AWS WAF attached to CloudFront distributions or ALBs for filtering malicious requests.  
   - IP-based filtering, protection against known common vulnerabilities.

2. Network Isolation  
   - VPC with segmented public, private, and database subnets.  
   - Security groups enforcing least privilege inbound/outbound rules.  
   - Use of nacls or ephemeral ports as needed.

3. Encryption Standards  
   - At rest: KMS-based encryption for EBS volumes, S3 buckets, RDS, DocumentDB, etc.  
   - In transit: TLS 1.3 for external endpoints, SSL between services as feasible.

4. Compliance Controls  
   - GuardDuty for continuous threat detection.  
   - CloudTrail for auditing all API calls across AWS.  
   - SecurityHub for unified visibility of security posture.  
   - Automatic backups with cross-region copy where possible.

5. Roles and Access  
   - IAM roles with strict policies (scoped to environment).  
   - Use of aws_provider_primary and aws_provider_secondary with assume_role, external_id.

6. Logging and Monitoring  
   - Enhanced logging for load balancers, VPC flow logs, API Gateway logs.  
   - Centralized metrics in CloudWatch or third-party aggregator (Datadog, Splunk).

## high_availability
The Dog Walking Platform invests in a multi-AZ and multi-region approach:

1. Multi-AZ Deployments  
   - Each AWS service (e.g., RDS, ECS, ASG) is provisioned in at least two Availability Zones within the primary region for redundancy.

2. Auto-Scaling Groups  
   - EC2-based solutions utilize ASGs that scale on CPU, memory, or custom CloudWatch metrics.  
   - ECS and EKS solutions incorporate smooth container scaling and rollouts.

3. Cross-Region Replication or Failover  
   - RDS databases replicate to a read replica in the secondary region if configured.  
   - Data backups automatically copied to us-west-2 if the primary region is us-east-1.  
   - Use of aws_provider_secondary for provisioning resources in us-west-2, ensuring consistent environment tagging.

4. Load Balancing Strategies  
   - Public ALBs for external requests, internal ALBs/NLBs for service-to-service communication.  
   - Weighted DNS or global accelerator can be used to shift traffic across regions if needed.

## disaster_recovery
Disaster recovery (DR) ensures minimal downtime when the primary region experiences a service interruption:

1. DR Planning  
   - Maintain active resources in the secondary region (e.g., minimal or warm-standby environment).  
   - Automated or manual failover processes.  
   - Thoroughly documented RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).

2. Testing DR Procedures  
   - Periodic DR drills (quarterly or bi-annual) to validate cross-region replication, DNS rerouting, and environment readiness.  
   - Confirm that all infrastructure is version-aligned, uses the same Terraform modules, and has consistent variable configurations.

3. Data Replication  
   - RDS automated backups replicated to the secondary region.  
   - S3 cross-region replication for crucial data or logs.  
   - State management: Terraform state stored in a resilient service (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB, or Terraform Cloud), accessible from any region.

4. Communication and Escalation  
   - Clear runbooks for DR events.  
   - On-call escalation paths to notify operations and management teams.

## troubleshooting
When issues arise, here are recommended steps:

1. Check Terraform Logs  
   - Use terraform plan or terraform apply with detailed logging.  
   - Inspect state file for resource drift or partial creation.

2. AWS Provider and Creds  
   - Validate that AWS credentials or assume_role sessions are correct.  
   - Confirm region or alias configurations in provider blocks match your expectations (aws_provider_primary vs aws_provider_secondary).

3. Resource Conflicts  
   - If resources fail to create, check VPC or subnet constraints (CIDR overlaps).  
   - Verify that necessary AWS service quotas (EC2, ELB, RDS) are not exceeded.

4. Security Misconfigurations  
   - Ensure your security groups and NACLs allow the necessary inbound/outbound traffic.  
   - Confirm IAM policies do not block certain provisioning actions.

5. Logs and Metrics  
   - Review CloudWatch logs, VPC flow logs, ALB logs, or ECS service logs for runtime exceptions.  
   - Investigate WAF if requests are being blocked or if you see suspicious patterns.

6. Rollbacks and Recovery  
   - Terraform is declarative; re-run terraform apply if partial resource creation leads to a stable state.  
   - Use “terraform taint RESOURCE_NAME” if a particular resource is stuck or hung.
