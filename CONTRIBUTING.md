Vulnerability Scanning, Penetration Testing, Security Incident Response
================================================================================
-->
## 6. Security Guidelines

### 6.1 Authentication Implementation
All API requests must include valid JWT tokens using RS256 signing. Sessions expire after 15 minutes by default, with refresh tokens rotating automatically. For high-sensitivity actions, enable multi-factor authentication.

### 6.2 Data Encryption Standards
All sensitive data in transit must use TLS 1.3. At rest, employ AES-256-GCM-based encryption with AWS KMS or equivalent. Where feasible, adopt field-level encryption for highly sensitive data.

### 6.3 API Security Measures
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protects against common attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
- **Identity Provider Integration**: Offloads authentication complexity and fosters single sign-on.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforce rate limits to mitigate abuse (e.g., 100 requests/min per user).  
- **IP Filtering**: Restrict access at sensitive endpoints to trusted networks or addresses.

### 6.4 Dependency Management
Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. Use automated tools to flag critical or high-severity issues. Pin dependencies to stable versions whenever possible.

### 6.5 Security Review Process
Seek security reviews for major changes. This includes new endpoints, data model updates, or third-party integrations. Document identified risks and remediation strategies before merging.

### 6.6 Vulnerability Scanning
Incorporate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline at each build. Monitor new vulnerabilities in upstream libraries and promptly address them.

### 6.7 Penetration Testing
Schedule external pen tests for major releases or critical components (e.g., payment gateway). Work with specialist teams to identify zero-day vulnerabilities or advanced threats.

### 6.8 Security Incident Response
In the event of an incident:
1. **Contain** the breach by disabling affected services.  
2. **Investigate** to determine root cause and impacted data.  
3. **Notify** relevant stakeholders (users, authorities) if required.  
4. **Remediate** by patching vulnerabilities and updating system configurations.  
5. **Document** the findings in a post-incident report, ensuring organizational learning.
